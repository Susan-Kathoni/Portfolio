      <h2 style="text-align:centre;"<b><i>About me</i></b></h2>
      <p>I have a BEd.(Arts) degree from Egerton university majoring in Eng./Lit.<br>I have taught Eng./Lit., History & Government and Christian Religious Education since 2017.
      <p>The reason why I decided to take a class on programming is because upon completion of my high school studies, I wanted to pursue Software Engineering but I had very little information about it and the best place to study it from. Early this year a friend of mine who is already a software engineer inspired me to become one.
      <p>My current interest is to know how to code and start a new career. My hobbies include:
        <ol>
          <li><i>Cycling</i></li>
          <li><i>Watching movies</i></li>
          <li><i>Surfing the internet to read and see different things</i></li>
          <li><i>Singing</i></li>
        </ol>

    <li><b>Educational background</b></li>
    <p>I have a Bachelor of Education(Arts) majoring in Eng./Lit. from Egerton university.</p>
    <li><b>Job Experience</b></li>
    <p>I have taught English/Literature, History & Government and C.R.E at St. Peter's Girls'
      School-Jet View since 2017.
      I have also been self-employed at a food kiosk for around three months.</p>
    <li><b>Why I decided to study Software development.</b></li>
    <p>After completion of my secondary school education, I wanted to pursue Information Technology
      but I was discouraged against it. My father thought that with a degree in Education, I would
      easily find a job. Early this year a close friend of mine rekindled my desire to venture into
      the ever-growing, dynamic and fun-filled world of technology.</p>
    <li><b>Interests</b></li>
    <p>Currently I am interested at learning Software development and building a successful career
      out of it.</p>
    <li><b>Hobbies</b></li>
    <p>They include: watching movies, cycling, doing nature walks etc.</p>
    <li><b>Skills</b></li>
    <p>They include: interpersonal skills, being flexible, basic computer skills etc.</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I have a BEd.(Arts) degree from Egerton university majoring in Eng./Lit.<br>I have taught Eng./Lit., History &
      Government and Christian Religious Education since 2017.
    <p>The reason why I decided to take a class on programming is because upon completion of my high school studies, I
      wanted to pursue Software Engineering but I had very little information about it and the best place to study it
      from. Early this year a friend of mine who is already a software engineer inspired me to become one.
    <p>My current interest is to know how to code and start a new career. My hobbies include:
    <ol>
      <li><i>Cycling</i></li>
      <li><i>Watching movies</i></li>
      <li><i>Surfing the internet to read and see different things</i></li>
      <li><i>Singing</i></li>
    </ol>
